# OpenSSL project roadmap

Last updated: 24 November 2023

From OpenSSL 3.3 onwards, the release priorities of each feature release of
OpenSSL are determined by a Release Steering Committee convened specifically for
that release. Each Release Steering Committee comprises the engineering manager,
a project contractor, and two specially invited members of the community, to
vary with each release. This ensures that our release priorities reflect the
priorities of our community.

## Future releases

### OpenSSL 3.3

We expect to deliver multi-stream QUIC server support in OpenSSL 3.3, to
complement the client-side support we shipped in OpenSSL 3.2.

We also hope to make progress in other areas, such as performance enhancements,
but are not committing to delivery in these areas for OpenSSL 3.3 at this time.

Like any OpenSSL feature release, OpenSSL 3.3 is also likely to incorporate
other features based on contributions from our community.

### OpenSSL 3.4

Feature releases after OpenSSL 3.3 will further mature QUIC functionality. The
exact priorities will be determined by the Release Steering Committee convened
to decide the release priorities, but it is likely that QUIC 0-RTT support, QUIC
datagram extension support and further work on performance enhancements to
OpenSSL as a whole will be priorities.
